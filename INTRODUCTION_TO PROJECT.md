our aim in this project is to try implementing the connect 4 game using the stack data structure and analyse our results and enhance our code by putting different test cases and check the time execution of our program. 



here are the rules of our games first:
Connect 4 Rules

OBJECTIVE:

To be the first player to connect 4 of the same colored discs in a row (either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally)


HOW TO PLAY:

First, decide who goes first and what symbol or color each player will have. 
Players must alternate turns, and only one disc can be dropped in each turn. 
On your turn, drop one of your colored discs from the top into any of the seven slots. 
The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row (horizontally , vertically or diagonally)

Data Structures & Algorithms Used: 

A 2-D char array has been used to build the game board which allows players to make a move.

The Linear Search Algorithm is used to check for win diagonally, horizontally or diagonally.

Stack Data Structure used to push & pop a move that has been made by a player.
